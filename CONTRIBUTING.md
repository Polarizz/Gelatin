## Style Guide

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). Some key points:

* Use descriptive names for types, variables, and functions
* Prefer clarity over brevity
* Use proper access control (`public`, `internal`, `private`)
* Document all public APIs with proper DocC comments
* Keep line length under 120 characters when possible

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Documentation

* All public APIs must have DocC documentation
* Include code examples in documentation where appropriate
* Update README.md if you change any public APIs
* Update API.md with detailed documentation for new features

## Testing

* Write unit tests for any new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
* Test your changes in the demo app
* Test on both iPhone and iPad if applicable

## Release Process

1. Update version numbers in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Create a GitHub release
4. Tag the release with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.2.3)

## Community

* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds
* Be respectful and considerate in your communication
* Assume good intentions from other contributors
